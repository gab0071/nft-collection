This is a Solidity contract for a non-fungible token (NFT) collection called "Crypto Devs". The contract implements the ERC721 and ERC721Enumerable interfaces, which define the standards for non-fungible tokens and for enumerating them, respectively. The contract also uses the Ownable contract from OpenZeppelin, which provides a basic access control mechanism for restricting certain functions to the contract owner.

The contract has several functions:

- `startPresale`: This function allows the contract owner to start a presale for the NFT collection. The presale is only available to whitelisted addresses.

- `presaleMint`: This function allows a user to mint one NFT during the presale. The user must be whitelisted and must send the correct amount of Ether with the transaction.

- `mint`: This function allows a user to mint one NFT after the presale has ended. The user must send the correct amount of Ether with the transaction.

- `_baseURI`: This function overrides the default implementation in the ERC721 contract and returns the base URI for the NFT collection.

The contract also has several variables:

- `_baseTokenURI`: This variable stores the base URI for the NFT collection.

- `_price`: This variable stores the price of one NFT in the collection.

- `_paused`: This variable is used to pause the contract in case of an emergency.

- `maxTokenIds`: This variable stores the maximum number of NFTs that can be minted in the collection.

- `tokenIds`: This variable stores the total number of NFTs that have been minted in the collection.

- `whitelist`: This variable stores an instance of the <a href="https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x2aaab846ce057a5effcd2a647cec7980bb9f347e#code"> whitelist contract</a>, which is used to check if a user is whitelisted. 

- `presaleStarted`: This variable is used to keep track of whether the presale has started or not.

- `presaleEnded`: This variable stores the timestamp for when the presale will end.

The contract also has a modifier called `onlyWhenNotPaused`, which prevents certain functions from being called if the contract is paused.

It was a fun and very interesting project because we connected two contracts through the `IWhitelist.sol` (this allowed us to save gas and only access the function that we required for this project) and we developed more logic to work with NFTs.
